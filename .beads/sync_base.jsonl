Without --hook, gt prime doesn't read session metadata from stdin, preventing autonomous execution from resumed sessions.\n\n**Fix Applied**:\n- Updated internal/rig/manager.go lines 997 and 1008 to include --hook flag\n- Pushed to main: commit 56e19a9c\n- Closed issue hq-gohdp\n\n**Note**: Existing witnesses need their settings updated or respawned to get the fix.

What should trigger a polecat to pick up newly hooked work?\n2. Should witnesses detect hooked work on done polecats and restart them?\n3. Is there a signal/nudge mechanism that's not firing?\n4. Should polecats be cleaned up after 'done' instead of reused?\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Fix polecat lifecycle to process hooked work\n2. Either: restart done polecats when work is hooked\n3. Or: clean up done polecats and create fresh ones for new work\n4. Clear the backlog of stale convoys\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Hooked work gets processed within reasonable time\n- No 'done' polecats sitting with unprocessed hooked work\n- Convoy count returns to normal (active work only)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"gastown/polecats/immortan","owner":"daniel.a.d.sauer@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:52:29.25281+01:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-12T16:28:46.102985+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-12T16:12:37.517568+01:00"}

WITHOUT THIS NOTIFICATION,\nPOLECAT WORKTREES ACCUMULATE INDEFINITELY AND THE LIFECYCLE BREAKS.\n\n**Step 3: Close MR Bead (REQUIRED - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)**\n\n⚠️ **VERIFICATION BEFORE CLOSING**: Confirm the work is actually on main:\n```bash\n# Get the commit message/issue from the branch\ngit log origin/main --oneline | grep \"\u003cissue-id\u003e\"\n# OR verify the commit SHA is on main:\ngit branch --contains \u003ccommit-sha\u003e | grep main\n```\n\nIf work is NOT on main, DO NOT close the MR bead. Investigate first.\n\n```bash\nbd close \u003cmr-bead-id\u003e --reason \"Merged to main at $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)\"\n```\n\nThe MR bead ID was in the MERGE_READY message or find via:\n```bash\nbd list --type=merge-request --status=open | grep \u003cpolecat-name\u003e\n```\n\n**VALIDATION**: The MR bead's source_issue should be a valid bead ID (gt-xxxxx),\nnot a branch name. If source_issue contains a branch name, flag for investigation.\n\n**Step 4: Archive the MERGE_READY mail (REQUIRED)**\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmerge-ready-message-id\u003e\n```\nThe message ID was tracked when you processed inbox-check.\n\n**Step 5: Cleanup (only after Steps 2-4 confirmed)**\n```bash\ngit branch -d temp\ngit push origin --delete \u003cpolecat-branch\u003e\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION GATE**: You CANNOT proceed to loop-check without:\n- [x] MERGED mail sent to witness\n- [x] MR bead closed\n- [x] MERGE_READY mail archived\n\nIf you skipped notifications or archiving, GO BACK AND DO THEM NOW.\n\nMain has moved. Any remaining branches need rebasing on new baseline.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T15:44:12.940014+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-12T15:44:12.940014+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"hq-wisp-4ps2","depends_on_id":"hq-wisp-p6m","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-12T15:44:12.946911+01:00","created_by":"gastown/refinery"},{"issue_id":"hq-wisp-4ps2","depends_on_id":"hq-wisp-sab3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T15:44:12.957791+01:00","created_by":"gastown/refinery"}],"ephemeral":true}

You watch polecats, nudge them toward\ncompletion, verify clean git state before kills, and escalate stuck workers.\n\n**You do NOT do implementation work.** Your job is oversight, not coding.\n\n## Ephemeral Polecat Model\n\nPolecats are truly ephemeral - done at MR submission, recyclable immediately:\n\n```\nPolecat lifecycle: spawning → working → mr_submitted → nuked\nMR lifecycle:      created → queued → processed → merged (Refinery handles)\n```\n\nOnce a polecat's branch is pushed (cleanup_status=clean), the polecat can be\nnuked immediately. The MR continues independently in the Refinery. If conflicts\narise, Refinery creates a NEW conflict-resolution task for a NEW polecat.\n\n**Key principle**: Polecat lifecycle is separate from MR lifecycle.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThis patrol follows Gas Town principles:\n- **Discovery over tracking**: Observe reality each cycle, don't maintain state\n- **Events over state**: POLECAT_DONE mail triggers immediate cleanup\n- **Ephemeral by default**: Clean polecats are nuked immediately, no waiting\n- **Cleanup wisps for exceptions**: Only created when intervention needed\n- **Task tool for parallelism**: Subagents inspect polecats, not molecule arms\n\n## Patrol Shape (Linear, Deacon-style)\n\n```\ninbox-check ─► process-cleanups ─► check-refinery ─► survey-workers\n                                                            │\n         ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n         ▼\n  check-timer-gates ─► check-swarm ─► ping-deacon ─► patrol-cleanup ─► context-check ─► loop-or-exit\n```\n\nNo dynamic arms. No fanout gates. No persistent nudge counters.\nState is discovered each cycle from reality (tmux, beads, mail).","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-12T17:24:42.110208+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-12T17:24:42.110208+01:00","ephemeral":true}

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck.
